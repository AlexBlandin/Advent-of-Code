# Advent of Code

> Quick and dirty solutions in a few languages (primarily Python)

Usage of `prep_files.py` requires `requests` and `markdownify`, and a `config.toml` that has your Advent `session = "..."` cookie in (it's `.gitignore`d)

## Requirements
- [`pip install -r requirements.txt`](https://www.python.org/)
  - [regenerate with `uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
